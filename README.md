# AutoMudaeRoller
This python program automatically types out the mudae command out on the discord app without typing it yourself

This program is made to be used for the discord bot called Mudae. I created it because i couldn't be bothered to type out the command every type i wanted to roll a character. This program allows you to input what command you want the program to type out, how many rolls you want to program to roll for you (how many times your command will be typed out) and, how many secs you want, so you have enough time to go from the terminal to dicsord.

This does not break discord's terms of service as it does not use the api. It justs emulates the keyboard.
